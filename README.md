# ICS635Assignment-3

This is for ICS 635 assignment 3 kaggle competition.

The problem aimed at addressing is the classification of high-energy particle collision events into two categories:

    •	Signal Events: Those that produce the Higgs Boson particle.
    •	Background Events: Those that do not produce the Higgs Boson.

The ability to accurately classify these events is critical in high-energy physics, as it allows scientists to identify rare particle interactions and make new discoveries. The challenge lies in distinguishing Higgs-producing events from the overwhelming background noise.

Goal: Train model to classify high-energy particle collision events correctly.
